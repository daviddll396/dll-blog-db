      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "When someone asks me what the best thing about being a developer is, my answer is always the same:\n\nIt's an endless game of learning.\n\nAnd most people either think it's a joke or think I'm crazy. But I'm not.\nThis is why I got into development. The ever-changing ecosystem and upcoming frameworks fuel my endless need to learn and grow.\nNever stop learning comes to mind when thinking about what it means to be a good developer.\n\nAnd I would say this should be the fact for every single one of us.\nThere is always something to learn, something that changed, or something you could improve on.\n\nIt also means we are never at 100%, making the hunt to become your best self even more fun.\n\nOnce upon a time There was a raging evil called 'imposter syndrome'.\nLet's paint a scene for a second.\n\nYou are a legendary Angular developer, but your company has a massive product that runs on Angular 10, so it's what you dream, breathe, and code like a legend.\n\nYou might be the best in the world when it comes to being an Angular 10 developer!\n\nAt one stage, the business might finally decide to switch, and they make a drastic decision to move everything over to Vue.\n\nYou've seen Vue, you know the basics, but the intern sitting next to you seems to be doing a better job than what you used to do ü§Ø.\n\nHowever, a good developer will put this feeling aside and take this as a learning opportunity.\n\nDive into Vue, master that, and you'll be back to your old self.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause good developers have a knack for learning, absorbing, and mastering things.\nNever stop learning!\n\nThere is always something we can improve on, learn more about, or even something new we could pick up.\n\nThat's what it means to be a developer.\nAnd that's why I fell in love with being one",

      "body": "Samsung‚Äôs new Galaxy S22 Ultra is getting a lot of buzz since it‚Äôs the reincarnation of the Note. By comparison, the regular S22 and S22 Plus are much more iterative with a design that‚Äôs similar to last year‚Äôs S21 lineup. It‚Äôs been reported that Samsung was disappointed with the sales performance of its flagship phones in 2021, and at first glance, there‚Äôs little about the S22 and S22 Plus that make them feel like must-have upgrades. They‚Äôve got the standard mix of camera and performance enhancements, but no big wow factor.\n\nBut so what? There‚Äôs something to be said for Samsung‚Äôs hardware quality and consistency. The OLED screens in Galaxy phones are always that extra little bit nicer ‚Äî in terms of uniformity, brightness, and so on ‚Äî than what you‚Äôll find in the Android competition. And the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that returns in the S22 is on a different level than, say, the Pixel 6‚Äôs slow reader.\n\nSamsung refined the design of the S22s with a flat screen, symmetrical bezels, and more rugged Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on both front and back. When you combine that elegant hardware with four years of promised Android software updates, I think it makes for a compelling phone. That‚Äôs true of the S22 Plus, at least. Watch our video hands-on for the full rundown before the S22 and S22 Plus go on sale on February 25th.",

      "body": "Western Digital says it has lost at least 6.5 exabytes (6.5 billion gigabytes) of flash storage due to contamination issues at its NAND production facilities. The contamination could see the price of NAND ‚Äî the main component of SSDs ‚Äî spike up to 10 percent, according to market research firm TrendForce. Any potential NAND shortages or price fluctuations could affect the PC market over the next few months, which had another big year in 2021 despite global chip shortages and demand for GPUs.\n\nThe contamination of materials used in the manufacturing processes appears to have been detected in late January at two plants in Japan, with Western Digital‚Äôs joint venture partner, Kioxia (previously Toshiba), revealing it has affected BiCS 3D NAND flash memory.\n\nWestern Digital and Kioxia‚Äôs partnership amounts to around 30 percent of the NAND flash market, according to TrendForce. Both Western Digital and Kioxia primarily supply SSD and eMMC storage drives for PCs, and Western Digital is one of the leading suppliers in the industry.\n\nIt‚Äôs not clear what caused the contamination, whether products on the market will need to be recalled, or when production will resume. Western Digital says it‚Äôs ‚Äúworking closely with its joint venture partner, Kioxia, to implement necessary measures that will restore the facilities to normal operational status as quickly as possible.‚Äù",

      "body": "Wordle‚Äôs acquisition by The New York Times has already stirred up controversy, from broken streaks to accusations the game has become harder. But here‚Äôs a big change the NYT isn‚Äôt shouting about: it‚Äôs altered Wordle‚Äôs solutions. As of today, February 15th (game number 241), the New York Times version of Wordle and the original version hosted at powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle have diverged and will now continue forever out of step.\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES TOLD PUBLICATIONS ‚ÄúNOTHING HAS CHANGED‚Äù\n\nChanges to Wordle‚Äôs word list by the NYT were spotted last week by a number of sources, including BoingBoing. Although some thought these changes only applied to the words you could guess, it turns out the Times also altered the list of possible solutions. (The Verge made this mistake as well ‚Äî we regret the error.) This confusion wasn‚Äôt helped by the fact that the Times itself was running round telling publications that everything was the same in Wordle land. As NYT comms director Jordan Cohen told The Guardian: ‚ÄúNothing has changed about the game play.‚Äù Which is really not true!\n\nSure, the game plays the same, but the Times has not only removed rude words like ‚Äúpussy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhore‚Äù from possible guesses, it‚Äôs also changed the game‚Äôs future solutions. And surely for a game all about guessing words this counts as a change to gameplay.\n\nWarning: spoilers for the non-NYT version of Wordle follow.\n\nAs BoingBoing notes, words that have been removed from guesses and solutions include ‚Äúfibre,‚Äù ‚Äúpupal,‚Äù ‚Äúslave,‚Äù and ‚Äúwench.‚Äù You can find a list of the original Wordle solutions here and can check that against NYT‚Äôs altered list by following these instructions here. A warning: clicking these links will spoil future solutions for you if you scroll too far ahead, so I‚Äôll save you the danger and just say that the Times has skipped today‚Äôs original solution (#241) of ‚Äúagora‚Äù and moved to the next day‚Äôs (#242), which is [cough-cough-mumble-mumble].",

      "title": "Billionaire who flew to orbit with SpaceX buys three new missions to space",
      "body": "Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who flew to Earth orbit on SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon capsule last year, plans to fly with SpaceX again. Today, Isaacman announced that he‚Äôs purchased three additional upcoming flights with SpaceX, a series of missions called ‚ÄúPolaris‚Äù that would take him deeper into space on the company‚Äôs spacecraft.\n\nIsaacman, who made his fortune through his payment processing company Shift4 Payments, made headlines last year when he bankrolled an entire SpaceX Crew Dragon passenger mission in September, dubbed Inspiration4. He filled the three remaining seats on the vehicle with other civilian astronauts, including a childhood cancer survivor, an engineer, and a professor. The quartet all trained and eventually flew to orbit together on a three-day trip while raising money for St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital.\n\nNow, it looks like Isaacman plans to recreate his Inspiration4 mission multiple times over and on increasingly grander scales. The three flights he‚Äôs bought include two missions on SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon that would fly to super-high orbits around Earth ‚Äî building block missions that would eventually lead to the first crewed flight on the company‚Äôs massive new Starship rocket. On the first Crew Dragon trip, called Polaris Dawn, Isaacman plans to fly again. He‚Äôs filling the remaining seats with two SpaceX employees, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, as well as Scott ‚ÄúKidd‚Äù Poteet, a former Air Force pilot who was the mission director for Inspiration4. And the flight would also serve as another St. Jude fundraising opportunity.\n\nFLYING WITH SPACEX AGAIN ‚Äî AND AGAIN AND AGAIN\nIf the flight is successful, it‚Äôd fly to the highest altitude that SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon capsule has ever gone, let alone with people on board. Isaacman claims the Polaris Dawn flight will go ‚Äúfarther into space than humans have gone since we‚Äôve last walked on the Moon,‚Äù he told the Today Show. So far, the Crew Dragon has only flown back and forth from low Earth orbit. The primary purpose of SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon is to ferry astronauts and cargo to and from the International Space Station for NASA. SpaceX flew its first crew of NASA astronauts on the vehicle in May of 2020, followed by a handful of other crews throughout the last few years. But the company has started branching out, flying its first fully private mission with Inspiration4, and it has plans to launch a series of private missions for the company Axiom to the International Space Station.\n\nThe Crew Dragon flights are meant to serve as precursor missions for testing out deep-space human travel with SpaceX while trying out some new capabilities. Polaris Dawn will include a spacewalk, which would be the first commercial one ever conducted. The walker will wear a new type of spacesuit designed for spacewalks, currently being developed by SpaceX based off of the pressure suits flyers wear on the Crew Dragon. The flight would also test out SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink ‚Äúlaser-based communications in space,‚Äù tapping into the massive satellite constellation the company is building to provide global broadband coverage. The mission will also investigate how the crew handles a deeper space environment, as the flight will take the four-person crew through the Van Allen Belts, a zone of radiated particles trapped in Earth‚Äôs magnetic field that extend deep into space.\n\nISAACMAN MAY BE WAITING A WHILE FOR HIS FINAL STARSHIP MISSION, THOUGH\nThe Polaris Dawn crew gave more details during a press conference following the announcement, which was light on specifics. They didn‚Äôt provide a specific altitude for their flight, only saying that they wanted to go to the highest Earth orbit ever flown. ‚ÄúIf you reference the Gemini mission, that‚Äôll give you an idea of the target,‚Äù Isaacman said.\n\nWhen asked about the progress toward the spacewalk suit, the crew did not say exactly how far along the design is. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fantastic team of brilliant engineers working on a spacesuit, and it‚Äôll be really exciting to work together as their design unfolds,‚Äù Menon said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll be certain to share more details with you as we get to that point.‚Äù\n\nWhile the spacewalker for this mission also hasn‚Äôt been chosen yet, the team indicated that in order for the spacewalker to leave the Crew Dragon, he or she would have to exit through an open hatch, exposing the rest of the crew to the vacuum of space.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no airlock, and so we will certainly be taking the entire team of four down to the vacuum,‚Äù Menon said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll certainly be doing so safely.‚Äù\n\nThe crew didn‚Äôt explain what ‚Äúsafely‚Äù meant, but presumably, the remaining three crew members would be wearing some kind of SpaceX suit as well when the hatch is opened. As of now, SpaceX has an iconic black and white pressure suit that is worn by astronauts on Crew Dragon during launch and reentry, meant to keep people alive in case of a sudden depressurization event. Those suits are not meant to be worn during a spacewalk, but they may still be able to keep astronauts alive in a vacuum for some time.\n\nAs far as budget, Isaacman wouldn‚Äôt say how much he‚Äôs spending on the mission, just that the Polaris program is a joint investment between himself and SpaceX. ‚ÄúWe know space is expensive,‚Äù Isaacman said. ‚ÄúAt this point, costs will come down, just as they have from any other, you know, groundbreaking technology.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWE KNOW SPACE IS EXPENSIVE.‚Äù\nAs of now, Polaris Dawn is targeting a launch in the fourth quarter of 2022, with more details to follow for the other missions. Ultimately these flights will culminate with the first crewed launch of the Starship vehicle, a gargantuan rocket SpaceX has been developing for the last few years to take large crews to the Moon and eventually Mars. Isaacman indicated that he might fly on the two follow-up missions. ‚Äúif we achieve our objectives on Polaris Dawn and don‚Äôt disappoint, I‚Äôll have the opportunity to participate in future Polaris missions,‚Äù he said.\n\nIsaacman may be waiting a while for his final Starship mission, though, as the vehicle is still in development and hasn‚Äôt even flown to space yet. Through 2020 and 2021, the company conducted a few high-altitude flight tests with Starship, sending the vehicle above 32,000 feet before attempting to land it back on the ground. During those tests, Starship successfully landed only once without blowing up. SpaceX is working toward getting Starship into orbit sometime this year, though its test flights are partly contingent on the Federal Aviation Administration granting SpaceX regulatory approval to launch Starship from the company‚Äôs South Texas launch facility. A decision on whether or not to grant that approval was expected at the end of the month, but today, the FAA said it would be extending its deadline to the end of March.\n\nEven if SpaceX does get Starship into orbit this year, there are still plenty of things the company must do before flying people on the vehicle into deep space. The company must develop life support systems, figure out how to fuel the vehicle in space, and show that it can land the people back on Earth after returning from deep space. It‚Äôs likely got years of development ahead.\n\nAs Starship goes through development, SpaceX continues to rack up customers for the vehicle. Last year, NASA awarded SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop Starship as a lander that would take the space agency‚Äôs astronauts to and from the lunar surface. And another billionaire, Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, also purchased a flight on Starship called Dear Moon that would take him and winners of a contest around the Moon. Today‚Äôs news comes just a few days after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gave his latest update on Starship down in Boca Chica, Texas ‚Äî the site of Starship‚Äôs development ‚Äî where he hinted about future flight profiles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be some future announcements that I think people will be pretty fired up about,‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúSo anyway, super exciting future ahead with this.‚Äù",
