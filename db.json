      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "When someone asks me what the best thing about being a developer is, my answer is always the same:\n\nIt's an endless game of learning.\n\nAnd most people either think it's a joke or think I'm crazy. But I'm not.\nThis is why I got into development. The ever-changing ecosystem and upcoming frameworks fuel my endless need to learn and grow.\nNever stop learning comes to mind when thinking about what it means to be a good developer.\n\nAnd I would say this should be the fact for every single one of us.\nThere is always something to learn, something that changed, or something you could improve on.\n\nIt also means we are never at 100%, making the hunt to become your best self even more fun.\n\nOnce upon a time There was a raging evil called 'imposter syndrome'.\nLet's paint a scene for a second.\n\nYou are a legendary Angular developer, but your company has a massive product that runs on Angular 10, so it's what you dream, breathe, and code like a legend.\n\nYou might be the best in the world when it comes to being an Angular 10 developer!\n\nAt one stage, the business might finally decide to switch, and they make a drastic decision to move everything over to Vue.\n\nYou've seen Vue, you know the basics, but the intern sitting next to you seems to be doing a better job than what you used to do ü§Ø.\n\nHowever, a good developer will put this feeling aside and take this as a learning opportunity.\n\nDive into Vue, master that, and you'll be back to your old self.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause good developers have a knack for learning, absorbing, and mastering things.\nNever stop learning!\n\nThere is always something we can improve on, learn more about, or even something new we could pick up.\n\nThat's what it means to be a developer.\nAnd that's why I fell in love with being one",

      "title": "Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S22 phones are the safe bet",
      "body": "Samsung‚Äôs new Galaxy S22 Ultra is getting a lot of buzz since it‚Äôs the reincarnation of the Note. By comparison, the regular S22 and S22 Plus are much more iterative with a design that‚Äôs similar to last year‚Äôs S21 lineup. It‚Äôs been reported that Samsung was disappointed with the sales performance of its flagship phones in 2021, and at first glance, there‚Äôs little about the S22 and S22 Plus that make them feel like must-have upgrades. They‚Äôve got the standard mix of camera and performance enhancements, but no big wow factor.\n\nBut so what? There‚Äôs something to be said for Samsung‚Äôs hardware quality and consistency. The OLED screens in Galaxy phones are always that extra little bit nicer ‚Äî in terms of uniformity, brightness, and so on ‚Äî than what you‚Äôll find in the Android competition. And the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that returns in the S22 is on a different level than, say, the Pixel 6‚Äôs slow reader.\n\nSamsung refined the design of the S22s with a flat screen, symmetrical bezels, and more rugged Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on both front and back. When you combine that elegant hardware with four years of promised Android software updates, I think it makes for a compelling phone. That‚Äôs true of the S22 Plus, at least. Watch our video hands-on for the full rundown before the S22 and S22 Plus go on sale on February 25th.",

      "title": "SSD prices could spike after Western Digital loses 6.5 billion gigabytes of NAND chips",
      "body": "Western Digital says it has lost at least 6.5 exabytes (6.5 billion gigabytes) of flash storage due to contamination issues at its NAND production facilities. The contamination could see the price of NAND ‚Äî the main component of SSDs ‚Äî spike up to 10 percent, according to market research firm TrendForce. Any potential NAND shortages or price fluctuations could affect the PC market over the next few months, which had another big year in 2021 despite global chip shortages and demand for GPUs.\n\nThe contamination of materials used in the manufacturing processes appears to have been detected in late January at two plants in Japan, with Western Digital‚Äôs joint venture partner, Kioxia (previously Toshiba), revealing it has affected BiCS 3D NAND flash memory.\n\nWestern Digital and Kioxia‚Äôs partnership amounts to around 30 percent of the NAND flash market, according to TrendForce. Both Western Digital and Kioxia primarily supply SSD and eMMC storage drives for PCs, and Western Digital is one of the leading suppliers in the industry.\n\nIt‚Äôs not clear what caused the contamination, whether products on the market will need to be recalled, or when production will resume. Western Digital says it‚Äôs ‚Äúworking closely with its joint venture partner, Kioxia, to implement necessary measures that will restore the facilities to normal operational status as quickly as possible.‚Äù",

      "body": "Wordle‚Äôs acquisition by The New York Times has already stirred up controversy, from broken streaks to accusations the game has become harder. But here‚Äôs a big change the NYT isn‚Äôt shouting about: it‚Äôs altered Wordle‚Äôs solutions. As of today, February 15th (game number 241), the New York Times version of Wordle and the original version hosted at powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle have diverged and will now continue forever out of step.\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES TOLD PUBLICATIONS ‚ÄúNOTHING HAS CHANGED‚Äù\n\nChanges to Wordle‚Äôs word list by the NYT were spotted last week by a number of sources, including BoingBoing. Although some thought these changes only applied to the words you could guess, it turns out the Times also altered the list of possible solutions. (The Verge made this mistake as well ‚Äî we regret the error.) This confusion wasn‚Äôt helped by the fact that the Times itself was running round telling publications that everything was the same in Wordle land. As NYT comms director Jordan Cohen told The Guardian: ‚ÄúNothing has changed about the game play.‚Äù Which is really not true!\n\nSure, the game plays the same, but the Times has not only removed rude words like ‚Äúpussy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhore‚Äù from possible guesses, it‚Äôs also changed the game‚Äôs future solutions. And surely for a game all about guessing words this counts as a change to gameplay.\n\nWarning: spoilers for the non-NYT version of Wordle follow.\n\nAs BoingBoing notes, words that have been removed from guesses and solutions include ‚Äúfibre,‚Äù ‚Äúpupal,‚Äù ‚Äúslave,‚Äù and ‚Äúwench.‚Äù You can find a list of the original Wordle solutions here and can check that against NYT‚Äôs altered list by following these instructions here. A warning: clicking these links will spoil future solutions for you if you scroll too far ahead, so I‚Äôll save you the danger and just say that the Times has skipped today‚Äôs original solution (#241) of ‚Äúagora‚Äù and moved to the next day‚Äôs (#242), which is [cough-cough-mumble-mumble].",
