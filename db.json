      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "When someone asks me what the best thing about being a developer is, my answer is always the same:\n\nIt's an endless game of learning.\n\nAnd most people either think it's a joke or think I'm crazy. But I'm not.\nThis is why I got into development. The ever-changing ecosystem and upcoming frameworks fuel my endless need to learn and grow.\nNever stop learning comes to mind when thinking about what it means to be a good developer.\n\nAnd I would say this should be the fact for every single one of us.\nThere is always something to learn, something that changed, or something you could improve on.\n\nIt also means we are never at 100%, making the hunt to become your best self even more fun.\n\nOnce upon a time There was a raging evil called 'imposter syndrome'.\nLet's paint a scene for a second.\n\nYou are a legendary Angular developer, but your company has a massive product that runs on Angular 10, so it's what you dream, breathe, and code like a legend.\n\nYou might be the best in the world when it comes to being an Angular 10 developer!\n\nAt one stage, the business might finally decide to switch, and they make a drastic decision to move everything over to Vue.\n\nYou've seen Vue, you know the basics, but the intern sitting next to you seems to be doing a better job than what you used to do ðŸ¤¯.\n\nHowever, a good developer will put this feeling aside and take this as a learning opportunity.\n\nDive into Vue, master that, and you'll be back to your old self.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause good developers have a knack for learning, absorbing, and mastering things.\nNever stop learning!\n\nThere is always something we can improve on, learn more about, or even something new we could pick up.\n\nThat's what it means to be a developer.\nAnd that's why I fell in love with being one",
